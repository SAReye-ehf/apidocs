# Authentication

SAReye uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register for a new API key at your user setup page http://{your_tenants_subdomain}.sardynamics.com/users

SAReye expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: abbe0983-7b75-53df-bc32-009b79d2c61e`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>abbe0983-7b75-53df-bc32-009b79d2c61e</code> with your personal API key.
